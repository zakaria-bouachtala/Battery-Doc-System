# Battery-Doc-System
LCD display of battery voltage and temperature with a warning circuit
# Features
* The acquisition of the temperature of a battery on the interval of **[0°c 60°c]**
  >Using 10-bit converter A/D
* The acquisition of the voltage of a battery on the interval of **[0V 12V]**
  >Using 10-bit converter A/D with resolution of **11.7mV**
* Visual Warning (**red flag**) when temperature is above of 30°c 
* Visual Warning (**Blinking two Leds**) when voltage is under 20% of its capacity
* Treatment & Displaying data 
  >Using 2x16 LCD display
